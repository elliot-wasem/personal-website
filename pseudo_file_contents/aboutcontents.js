        <p>Hello,</p>\
        <p>I am a software engineer with a passion for the low-level, and the logically pure.<p/>\
        <p>I am currently working as an embedded software engineer for critical aerospace<br/>\
        missions, but this is just a small part of what I like to do. I also have a passion<br/>\
        for creative problem solving, and believe that programming is an art form, as much<br/>\
        as it is a medium for many engineering disciplines. It is for this reason that I feel<br/>\
        Linux and other open-source, large-scale projects are incredibly beautiful. For Linux<br/>\
        and others to succeed, they must be well written, well documented, and properly tested<br/>\
        in addition to being correct.</p>\
        <p>My favorite programming philosophies fall upon the two furthest ends of the spectrum.<br/>\
        I love C for its simplicity and unerring allowance of complete control over data.<br/>\
        I love C for its willingness to let me come up with creative ways to manipulate data in<br/>\
        primitive fashion. I love C because it allows me to be so close to the data I'm<br/>\
        manipulating in a way that higher level languages simply do not allow.</p>\
        <p>On almost the complete polar end of the spectrum, I also love Erlang, and the sheer<br/>\
        and ridiculous power it gives you to manipulate processes and perform extremely complex<br/>\
        messaging sequences in such a small amount of code, allowing you to think about what<br/>\
        you're trying to model instead of hyperfocusing on the data movement itself.</p>\
        <p>But when it comes down to it, sometimes you simply need to use the tools at hand.<br/>\
        Whether that's Java and its fixation on object-oriented design, C++ and its wild<br/>\
        permittance of overloading and syntactic abstraction, or simply automation in Bash,<br/>\
        my biggest joy is to solve problems, teach others, and move the field of software<br/>\
        engineering forward.<p/>\
