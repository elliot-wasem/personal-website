                Prior to reading this, a common working knowledge of the C programming
                language is very helpful. Additionally, it will be helpful to have read through
                the man pages for
                <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html"><span class="highlight">fork(2)</span></a>,
                and
                <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/wait.2.html"><span class="highlight">wait(2)</span></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A process is a running set of instructions that you might commonly call a "program". However, a program
                (which is loosely defined as a piece of software created to solve a problem) can have many processes,
                all of which must be uniquely identified. To achieve this, each process (regardless of its position as a
                standalone process in a program or a process among many in a program) has a procces identifier (PID).
            </p>
            <p>
                Each process consists of its own memory space, which means it has its own stack, heap, and all other
                segments of memory. One process does not have access to another process's address space. This is
                important for what comes later.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you run a program, the operating system creates a processes, and starts your program with the
                <span class="highlight">main()</span> function. Now, if the operating system can create new processes,
                why can't you? Well, it turns out you can! This can be achieved with the system call <span
                    class="highlight">fork()</span>. <span class="highlight">fork()</span>
                takes no parameters, and its functionality is simple: it creates an exact copy of the process from which
                it was called. This includes the stack, the heap, and any additional associated data. Now, it should be
                noted that modern implementations of <span class="highlight">fork()</span> don't create a full copy, but
                rather use a technique called
                <i>copy-on-write</i>, but this is beyond the scope of this document. For all intents and purposes, you
                can
                consider the new process as having its own complete copy of the address space.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a process is successfully created, the new process is called the <i>child</i> process, and the
                original process is called the <i>parent</i> process.
            </p>
            <p>
                A call to <span class="highlight">int pid = fork();</span> can end in the following situations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">pid &lt 0</span>: An error has occurred, and no process has been created.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">pid &gt= 0</span>: A process has been created.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>if <span class="highlight">pid &gt 0</span>, then the current process is the parent process, and
                        the PID of the child process is stored in <span class="highlight">pid</span>.</li>
                    <li>if <span class="highlight">pid == 0</span>, then the current process is the child process.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The following snippet of code describes the behavior:
            </p>
            <pre><code>int pid = fork();

if (pid &lt 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "An error occurred!\n");
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
} else if (pid &gt 0) {
    printf("This is the parent process, and the child process's PID is %d.\n", pid);
} else {
    // pid == 0
    printf("This is the child process.\n");
}</code></pre>
            <p>If the above code is run, either it will print "An error occurred!", or it will print one of the
                following:</p>
            <pre><code>This is the parent process, and the child process's PID is &ltchild PID&gt.
This is the child process.</code></pre>
            <pre><code>This is the child process.
This is the parent process, and the child process's PID is &ltchild PID&gt.</code></pre>
            <p>
                Huh? Why could it be either order? That's because, once the child process is created, there is no
                guarantee which will run first, the parent or the child. Don't believe me? Try it! Compile it to some
                program. Say the program is called <span class="highlight">fork_test</span>. Execute the following in
                Bash:
            </p>
            <pre><code>for _ in {1..100}; do
    echo "---------------------------------------------";
    ./fork_test;
done</code></pre>
            <p>
                Chances are, you will see each of the two orders at least once, and if nothing goes wrong, you will
                never see the error message.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, there is one thing we have seen that remains shared between the parent and the child, and that is
                file descriptors. If the parent opens a file descriptor before calling <span
                    class="highlight">fork</span>, after the call to <span class="highlight">fork</span> the child will
                have access to the opened file. This can lead to some fun synchronicity issues, and must be taken into
                account. What happens if the parent and child processes both read from the file at the same time? Write
                yourself a test program to see what happens.
            </p>
            <p>
                But wait, there's more! There's a bit of a problem that can occur in the above program snippet. That
                problem arises from one simple fact. When a <i>parent</i> process dies, all its <i>child</i> processes
                will be killed as well. So, if the <i>parent</i> prints its piece first, and then exits before the
                child, there's a (admittedly slim) chance that the child process may never print its piece. To avoid
                this, we can have the parent process <span class="highlight">wait()</span> on the child process to
                complete. We can do this as follows. Much of the code is duplicated from above:
            </p>
            <pre><code>int pid = fork();

if (pid &lt 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "An error occurred!\n");
} else if (pid &gt 0) {
    printf("This is the parent process, and the child process's PID is %d.\n", pid);
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
} else {
    // pid == 0
    printf("This is the child process.\n");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

int status;
if (wait(&status) &lt 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to wait on the child process.\n");
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
}

printf("Child process exited with status code %d.\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));

return EXIT_SUCCESS;
</code></pre>
            <p>
                The following changes were made:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The child process explicitly exits with a successful status after it prints its piece.</li>
                <li>The parent process continues execution outside of the if-statement block.</li>
                <li>The parent waits on the child process to return, capturing its exit status.</li>
                <li>The parent prints the exit status of the child.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There are a few more pieces here. <span class="highlight">wait()</span> takes a pointer to an integer,
                which it fills with the return status of the child process which exits. We then must call <span
                    class="highlight">WEXITSTTATUS(status)</span> to get the actual numeric return code from the
                returned integer. Furthermore, if the call to <span class="highlight">wait()</span> fails, it will
                return -1. As long as the call to <span class="highlight">wait()</span> does not fail, the parent
                process will <i>block</i> until there is a child process to collect. Blocking in this case means that it
                will pause execution and, well, <i>wait</i>.</p>
            <p>There are numerous ways in which a software developer might want to use <span>fork()</span> and
                <span>wait()</span>, and the limit of these uses are your imagination and creativity!</p>
