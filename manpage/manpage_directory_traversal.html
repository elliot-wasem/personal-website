                Prior to reading this, a common working knowledge of the C programming language is very helpful.
                Furthermore, it will help if you have read through the man pages for
                <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readdir.3.html"><span
                        class="highlight">readdir(3)</span></a>,
                <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/opendir.3.html"><span
                        class="highlight">opendir(3)</span></a>,
                <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/closedir.3.html"><span
                        class="highlight">closedir(3)</span></a>.
                Additionally, read through <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/fstatat"><span
                        class="highlight">fstatat(2)</span></a>,
                as it has a better description of some of the functionality provided by <span
                    class="highlight">stat(2)</span>
                than is present in that man page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take note especially of a suite of functions packed in with <span
                    class="highlight">&ltsys/stat.h&gt</span>:
            </p>
            <p>
                Given some <span class="highlight">struct stat sb</span> which was populated with a call to <span
                    class="highlight">stat(2)</span>...
            </p>
            <pre><code>S_ISBLK(sb.st_mode);  /* is block special? */
S_ISCHR(sb.st_mode);  /* is character special? */
S_ISDIR(sb.st_mode);  /* is directory? */
S_ISFIFO(sb.st_mode); /* is fifo (first-in first-out)? */
S_ISLNK(sb.st_mode);  /* is symlink? */
S_ISREG(sb.st_mode);  /* is regular file? */
S_ISSOCK(sb.st_mode); /* is socket? */</code></pre>
            <p>
                You can use these functions to tell if a file is of a certain type.
            </p>
            <p>
                Directory reading and traversal is controlled by two things:
                A directory pointer (<span class="highlight">DIR *</span>)
                and a <span class="highlight">struct dirent</span> as follows
                (and as defined in <span class="highlight">man 3 readdir</span>):
            </p>
            <pre><code>struct dirent {
    ino_t          d_ino;       /* Inode number */
    off_t          d_off;       /* Not an offset; this can be ignored */
    unsigned short d_reclen;    /* Length of this record */
    unsigned char  d_type;      /* Type of file; not supported
                                 * by all filesystem types */
    char           d_name[256]; /* Null-terminated filename */
};</code></pre>
            <p>
                The <span class="highlight">DIR *</span> maintains the current open
                directory, and is handed to us by a call to
                <span class="highlight">opendir(const char *name)</span>
                (where <span class="highlight">name</span> is a character array holding
                a string representing the directory). We can perform two operations on a
                <span class="highlight">DIR *</span>:
                <span class="highlight">readdir(DIR *dirp)</span> and
                <span class="highlight">closedir(DIR *dirp)</span>.
                <span class="highlight">readdir</span> allows us to systematically read through
                each entry in a directory. It reads in no particular order, and will read in
                hidden files (those starting with a <span class="highlight">.</span>), as well as
                the current directory <span class="highlight">.</span> and parent directory
                <span class="highlight">..</span>. Ultimately a directory is just a structured file
                that a filesystem can read to figure out where the children of a directory are, and
                doesn't innately have any sense of order. <span class="highlight">ls</span> appearing
                ordered alphabetically is a feature of its implementation, not of the filesystem itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each call to <span class="highlight">readdir</span> will give us a pointer to a
                <span class="highlight">struct dirent</span>, or to <span class="highlight">NULL</span>
                if we have exhausted the directory, or if an error occured. The
                <span class="highlight">struct dirent</span> can tell us several things about the file to
                which it refers. For example, we can tell the file's name. Keep in mind, this is just the
                name of the file, not its entire path.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, let us simply read through a directory, and each time we reach a file,
                we will detect if it is another directory or not.

            <p>Try playing around with this code. What happens if you try to read a file that you
                don't have permissions on? What if, instead of calling
                <span class="highlight">opendir</span> on <span class="highlight">"."</span>,
                we call it on some other directory? What if we don't have read or execute permissions
                on that directory?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, as it turns out, we actually need execute permissions on a directory for us to
                open it and read its contents. It may feel counterintuitive, but this is a common
                problem that people run into when they're trying to debug why their program won't work.
            </p>
            <p>
                How can we recursively call this for all subdirectories? Since we know how to check the
                type of a file, how will this information help us recurse?
