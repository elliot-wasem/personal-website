                Prior to reading this, a common working knowledge of the C programming
                language is very helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
                This demo will go over the semantics of dynamically linked libraries as
                used in C. Look for parallels between this and opening/reading/closing
                a file/directory/etc in <a href="manpage_directory_traversal.html">this post</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A dynamically linked library is a compiled binary similar to an object file
                (think <span class="highlight">foo.o</span>) that has been compiled such that
                other executing programs can use the functions therein for their own purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's say, for instance, that we have some trivial file called
                <span class="highlight">my_dl.c</span> whose contents are as follows:
            </p>
            <pre><code>int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                That's it, no headers, no extra fluff, it is what it is: a file that contains
                a simple declaration and definition of a function that adds two numbers.
                Note the types of parameters (<span class="highlight">int</span> and
                <span class="highlight">int</span>) and the return type (also
                <span class="highlight">int</span>) as these will be important later.
            </p>
            <p>
                To compile this into a shared object file, we must call
                <span class="highlight">gcc</span> as follows:
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o my_dl.so my_dl.c</code></pre>
            <p>
                The <span class="highlight">-fPIC</span> option creates a position-independent
                shared library. This means that the code is not dependent on being offset
                relative to some other bit of code. This makes it suitable for inclusion in a
                shared library. For trivial examples like this, we do not need it. However,
                for more complex libraries it can be important.
            </p>
            <p>
                After running the previous command, we have created a shared object file called
                <span class="highlight">my_dl.so</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let us now start to build a driver program to test that our shared object library
                was built properly. First, let us create a C file, and we will call it
                <span class="highlight">dl_practice.c</span>. At the top of
                <span class="highlight">dl_practice.c</span> let us include the following libraries:
            </p>
            <pre><code>#include &ltstdio.h&gt
#include &ltstdlib.h&gt
#include &ltdlfcn.h&gt</code></pre>
            <p>
                Next, let's create a <span class="highlight">main()</span>, and inside it declare
                a couple variables we will need later:
            </p>
            <pre><code>int main() {
    void *handle;
    int (*add)(int, int);</code></pre>
            <p>
                The <span class="highlight">void *handle</span> will be a handle to our shared
                library once we open it. The function pointer <span class="highlight">add</span>
                will be how we will access the function in our shared library. Note that the name
                <span class="highlight">add</span> is not important, but rather the return type and
                the parameter types are what are important.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, let us open our shared library:
            </p>
            <pre><code>    handle = dlopen("./my_dl.so", RTLD_NOW);
    if (!handle) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Failed to create handle: %s.\n", dlerror());
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }</code></pre>
            <p>
                There are a few things to note here. If the call to
                <span class="highlight">dlopen</span> fails, <span class="highlight">handle</span>
                will contain the value <span class="highlight">NULL</span>. The flag
                <span class="highlight">RTLD_NOW</span> is one of two values that must be passed there,
                the other being <span class="highlight">RTLD_LAZY</span>. This just has to do with how
                and when the library is loaded. We won't concern ourselves with this for now and just
                use <span class="highlight">RTLD_NOW</span>. Note also the use of
                <span class="highlight">dlerror</span> to get the "reason" for failure. This is
                analogous to the use of <span class="highlight">strerror(errno)</span> in our past
                programs, but is specifically for the <span class="highlight">dlfcn</span> library.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, we have a handle to our library. However, we cannot actually use the function
                yet. This is because we need to actually load that function. To do so, we will
                make the following call:
            </p>
            <pre><code>    *(int**)(&add) = dlsym(handle, "add");</code></pre>
            <p>
                Now, our function pointer <span class="highlight">add</span> can call the function
                we declared in our shared library. Therefore, if we were to call
                <span class="highlight">printf("%d\n", add(2, 3));</span>, the number 5 would be printed
                to standard out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, when we are done using our shared library we must make sure we close it. To do so,
                make the following call:
            </p>
            <pre><code>    dlclose(handle);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Do you notice any similarity between this and opening/closing a file?</p>
            <p>
                To compile this driver program, we do not need to change the
                <span class="highlight">#include</span>d libraries at the top. However, we do need to
                pass one additional flag to <span class="highlight">gcc</span> so that we can use
                <span class="highlight">dlfcn</span>:
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ gcc -o dl_practice dl_practice.c -Wall -Werror -pedantic-errors -ldl</code></pre>
            <p>
                The <span class="highlight">-ldl</span> at the end tells <span class="highlight">gcc</span>
                to find the <span class="highlight">dlfcn</span> library and include it.
            </p>
            <p> My whole <i>very</i> simple makefile for this little demo looks as follows:</p>
            <pre><code>all:
    gcc -shared -fPIC -o my_dl.so my_dl.c -Wall -Werror -pedantic-errors
    gcc -o dl_practice dl_practice.c -Wall -Werror -pedantic-errors -ldl
clean:
    rm *.so dl_practice</code></pre>
            <p>
                Once you get it working, try making some more dynamically linkable shared
                libraries. Try new functions and function signatures. Try creating two
                functions with the same name but different behavior in two separate libraries.
                How does this work? What happens? What did you expect to happen?
